This goes over some laboratory assignments in C such as:|
• Processes
• Signals
• File I/O
• Pipes
• Threads
• Parallel Threads
• Mutexes
• Semaphores
• Signal Handling

What this laboratory is helpful for:

1. Learn the design and implementation of prevalent Operating Systems strategies through
stage-wise systems software creation that encourages critical thinking (to identify and
evaluate system design tradeoffs).
2. Develop a comprehensive understanding of different Operating Systems management
primitives, such as process, and resource management; including scheduling, paging,
concurrency control, communication, and synchronization. (c, k)
3. Learn modern Operating Systems concepts and techniques, such as SMP, microkernels,
clusters, disc allocation, memory management, and Objected Oriented Design (a, b, c, i).
4. Learn threads and multithreading concepts and techniques in Operating Systems (a, b, c,
i).
5. Learn Operating Systems functions associated with Input / Output operations and file
management (with deadlock avoidance, detection, and recovery).
